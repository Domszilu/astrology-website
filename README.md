# Single Page Application project

## Description

This website is being created as a project task for my single page application module.

I wanted to code for a project that stays close to me, therefore I picked astrology.

For now the main goal is to practice by using as many of the things I have learned in this module as possible.

## To do

- navbar
  - dropdown menu?, logo, login (mainly design)
  - home, about, contact
- home page brief introduction and description, a call to action => /create-chart
- contact -> form
- display fetched data
